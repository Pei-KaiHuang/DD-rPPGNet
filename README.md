## Prerequisite
Please check `requirement.txt` for the required Python libraries.

## Training & Testing
Please make sure your dataset is processed and modify the code in `dataloader.py`, `train.py` and `test.py`.
Once the code is updated, you can run `train.sh` directly to start training and testing."

## Acknowledgment of Outstanding Contributions
I am deeply grateful to Ya-Ting Chan for her outstanding contributions to this work.
